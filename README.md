## SMTP server setup

# GitHub Image Uploads (Optional)

This project can upload project images directly to a GitHub repository via the server API. This keeps your site static while letting you add images from the Admin panel.

## Configure

1. Create a GitHub Personal Access Token with repo scope.
2. Set these environment variables for the API server (locally in `.env`, on Vercel as Project Env Vars):

```
GITHUB_UPLOAD_ENABLED=true
GITHUB_OWNER=your-github-username-or-org
GITHUB_REPO=your-assets-repo
GITHUB_BRANCH=main
GITHUB_BASE_PATH=public/images/projects
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
GITHUB_COMMITTER_NAME=Website Uploader
GITHUB_COMMITTER_EMAIL=you@example.com
STORAGE_DRIVER=github # or local
ADMIN_API_TOKEN=super-secret-admin-token
```

Notes:
- Use a separate repository for assets if you donâ€™t want commits in your code repo.
- The server will fall back to local disk storage if `GITHUB_UPLOAD_ENABLED` is not `true` or variables are missing.
- Uploaded images are returned as `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/...` URLs and are saved into your `data/projects.json` when you save the project.

## Image validation & optimization

- Server validates image type (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF) and max size (10MB)
- Images are auto-optimized and converted to WebP using `sharp`
- Admin requests to image endpoints can require `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_API_TOKEN>` if set

## Run locally

```
npm run dev:all
```

## Deploy

- Deploy the frontend as usual.
- Deploy the API server with the same environment variables. If using a single deployment, ensure the Node server runs and is reachable by the frontend at `/api/*`.
- Set `VITE_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` in your frontend environment; it will be sent as `Authorization: Bearer` for Admin image actions.

Create a `.env` file at the project root with:

```
SMTP_MAIL=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
TO_EMAIL=your_destination_email@example.com
```

Start dev with both servers:

```
npm run dev:all
```
